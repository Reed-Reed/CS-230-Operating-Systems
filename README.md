  'The Gaming Room' (TGR) is a company who is looking to distribute their pictionary-esque game over multiple platforms.
The game renders a picture to the screens of each player, and the player to guess what the picture is of 
first wins the round. TGR wants a web-based game developed so that any platform may access the game.

  While developing the software design document, I think I did well in recommending hardware when it comes to memory or storage.
The UML diagram of the document is something I found particularly helpful when developing the code. The relationships
between classes and attributes are a good reference to have. 

  I would have liked if the document had more specific outlines regarding the operating platform to choose
  for the application development or deployment. In the future when designing software, I want to dive deeper into the 
  advantages and disadvantages of each component, perhaps creating a table that has more cells or accomodate more specific 
  questions.
